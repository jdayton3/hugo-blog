Hi! I'm Jonathan.

I'm a biology MS student at Brigham Young University interested in deep learning, and I graduate April 2019. I'm doing cancer research and IT work.

Check out my GitHub for projects I've worked on, take a look at my LinkedIn for my resume, and shoot me an email if you have any questions.
